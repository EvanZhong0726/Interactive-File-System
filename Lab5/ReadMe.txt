Lab 5 Readme

notes:






Past Errors:
rn hi.txt hello
	closes program
rn hi
	closes program
touch -p hi
	used to create broken file -p hi that was listed in ls

cat hi.txt
	when i enter data and :wq it doesn't quit
	this was due to it needing a password but not prompting

for ds hi.txt when password is inputted it displays but should ask for password

rn messes up ls formating
	we fixed by editing width value

lots of times when I input password it takes it but it also prints the message "command not found" because it thinks its a command
	we fixed by flushing cin
